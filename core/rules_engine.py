"""
Rules-Based Fundamental Filter
------------------------------

This module performs an initial screening of stocks using fundamental metrics
and macroeconomic context before passing them to ML-based evaluation.

Key Functions:
- evaluate_stock(ticker, macro): 
    Returns a signal ("BUY ‚úÖ", "HOLD üü°", "SELL ‚ùå", "TOO SMALL ‚ùå")
    based on weighted scoring against predefined thresholds.

Inputs:
- Fundamental data: EPS Growth, Revenue Growth, Debt/Equity, P/E, Market Cap, Avg Volume
- Macro environment status (passed externally)

Logic:
- Applies minimum liquidity filters (Market Cap, Avg Volume)
- Scores metrics based on whether they meet or exceed thresholds
- Adjusts final signal based on macroeconomic outlook

Output:
- signal: Discrete recommendation
- confidence: % confidence based on score
- details: Raw metrics used for evaluation

This is used as a fast, explainable pre-screening layer to discard low-quality stocks.
